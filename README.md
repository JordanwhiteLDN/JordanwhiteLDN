====================================================================================================================================

Aspiring Data Engineer and Data Analyst
---------------------------------------

My name is Jordan White, I live in London which is where I studied growing up. I was fortunate enough to attend and graduate from Ravensbourne university achieving an arts bachelors degree in 2016. Recently I completed a tech bootcamp course as a way to transition into the world of data so that I could introduce more structure in my work life. I consider myself a digital native so the tech industry feels like a logical decision. Since being on the course I have gained experience using Tableau, Power BI, MySQL and python. I am currently working on creating a git hub account so I can showcase some of the projects I have worked on. With regard to work experience, I have lots under my belt. For example, I worked for an escaper room for a couple of years where I developed my soft skills as part of a vibrant team, I've also worked for events as part of the bar staff team for 2 different agencies where punctuality and dress code were important. As for working with technology, I once worked a sales assistant for a computer exchange where a positive attitude was needed when tech didn‚Äôt work. I am now currently a freelancer in the film industry specialising in lighting but I am wanting to transition in to tech as a career and so I am up skilling and working towards achieving a Data engineer role in an effort to provide service in role that allows me to work from home.
